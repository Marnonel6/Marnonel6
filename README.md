I am a robotics engineer with a passion for solving complex challenges using cutting-edge technology.

Check out my project portfolio for some of my robotics/engineering projects.
https://marnonel6.github.io/

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Stellenbosch University  and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics from Northwestern University. My studies have included significant coursework in embedded systems, machine learning, robotic manipulation, machine dynamics, sensing, and navigation. As an engineer, I enjoy working on challenging projects that combine multiple disciplines, from mechanical design and control systems to software development.

My most notable project involved programming a quadruped robot dog with voice and object recognition for navigation, aimed at assisting visually impaired individuals. My experience includes leading a team of four in developing a Python ROS2 package for a 7-DOF robot arm to autonomously play air-hockey. I also designed, built, and tested a thrust vector controlled scaled rocket, including implementing a PID controller and a state machine for autonomous active orientation control in-flight and recovery. Additionally, I have designed and built an unmanned aerial vehicle with a Pixhawk Cube Orange flight computer and programmed a Raspberry Pi for autonomous control of an autonomous beverage cooler.

During my internships, I have worked with CranioTech, Inc., where I executed viability tests on a 3D orthodontic surgery software for implant design and created 3D patient-specific implants through titanium 3D printing. At Seedmaster, Inc. and Raven, Inc., I collaborated with the assembly team to assemble an autonomous robotic farming platform and conducted uphill seeding field testing on the autonomous platform for data collection. At Bronberg Dynamics (Pty), Ltd., I programmed a PID controller for turbine blade orientation and devised, constructed, and tested a low-cost functional prototype single-blade wind turbine for remote environments to improve electricity security.

My skills include programming in Python, C++, C, Bash, R, and Assembly Language. In robotics, I have experience with ROS2/(ROS), Gazebo, MoveIt, Machine Learning, OpenCV, SLAM, Computer Vision, Control systems design, and Embedded systems. Additionally, I have expertise in manufacturing using Inventor, Fusion360, OnShape, SolidWorks, Rapid Manufacturing, Machining, EAGLE, KiCAD, and PCB Design. I am proficient in Linux, Git, CMake, Unit Testing, Ardupilot, and MATLAB software.
